- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nevernie
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Python to be able to teach my learners 13-18 years old. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that it is a vast black hole and too much jabber and frills, I want the nitty gritty, the basics. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a class attendance register for the 10 subjects about 320 learners attend daily. 
- 📫 How to reach me faldela2@gmail.com
